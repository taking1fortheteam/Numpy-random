Created by Aidan Conlon 11 Nov 2019 as a student of GMIT attending Level 8 course in Data Analytics - Programming for Data Analytics Assignment due 11 Nov 2019.

Note:

Reading through the Advice For Students note in the assignment brief, I believe I must add some information in here as I did not come at this assignment with any great rigour. And the final few days have proved me wrong in my belief that I can swan in at the last hurdle and grab Gold! Well not the case!

I was a little confused by the terminology in the brief i.e. packages, distributions, functions, libraries etc. My initial undertanding of the assignment was one thing, but the closer I got to the submittal date I realised the err in my ways. 

That said, I have learned a great deal in Jupyter Notebooks. It is not a medium I am familiar with and it leaves a lot of questions unanswered for me. THe most difficult task in all this I found was trying to come up with material that seemed relevant. I mean how interesting can 5 distributions of a Random FUnction actually be? Go figure! I am not one that is easily excited, but data analytics is not something I have a real passion for. Maybe I am at an ebbin my career or my studies, either way, I will continue to trundle on through. I do enjoy programming and I see this course allowing me to gain a massive amount of knowledge in this area. UNfortunately I am not sure if my work will allow my exploration into such places after it is complete. 

One of the other most difficult areas in this assignment was trying to get to grips with LaTex with little time to do very much research. This is not something I can hit the ground running, and where I may have wanted to place many formulae of the various distributions within the Notebook, I am afraid I would be here until 2020 bundling my way through it I fear. LaTex is another programming language that is very particular and very unforgiving. I do not want to have to learn another application / language just so I can create a mathematical formula....I just believe there are easier ways to do these things and it would save the students that struggle with these sall diversions a lot of stress.  

Online resources I find difficult to locate when I am searching for something very specific. I also find the environment for Python very painful to have to open applications, directories, websites, link them, etc. etc. THis whole side to the data analytics is the most difficult for me as it appears to be designed for engineers by engineers. I am an engineer but I have great issues with the way things are done and expected of us. Now I do know from my time in FT education, things have moved on greatly so these tools are a lot better than they were.....but wouldn;t you think, with the massive amount of grey matter going theough tthe GMIT gates (virtual or real) each day, a better system could be developed inhouse fot eh GMIT staff and students studying there? 

Thats all for now. I do hope if you come back to me in a  few weeks time this rant brings back the memories of this particular assignment.....just in case!! :)
